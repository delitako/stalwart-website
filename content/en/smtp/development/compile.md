## Overview

Compiling Stalwart SMTP from the source has the main advantage that binaries are built
with optimizations specific to your hardware which may result in better performance.
Another advantage is that you may enable or disable features to suit your needs.

To compile Stalwart SMTP you need the latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Install Rust

The fastest way to install rust is with ``rustup``. On Unix systems run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you are running Windows 64-bit, download and run [rustupâ€‘init.exe](https://rustup.rs), then follow the onscreen instructions. 

## Clone Repo

Clone the Stalwart SMTP repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stalwartlabs/smtp-server.git
cd smtp-server
```

## Compile

Install `protoc`:

```
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```

And then compile Stalwart SMTP by executing:

```
cargo build --release
```

Once the compilation process is completed, the Stalwart SMTP
binary will be available under ``target/release/stalwart-smtp``.
